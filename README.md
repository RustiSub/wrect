# WRECT#

Wrect is an attempt to build a game engine that is suitable for prototyping various ideas.

It was first build using Pixi.js  then ported to use Three.js, then made abstract enough to handle both and other possible future rendering engines.

This is merely a placeholder for an eventual rundown of how the Engine works and how it could be used.
